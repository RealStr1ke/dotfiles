[output]

# Ouput method. Can be 'ncurses', 'noncurses' or 'raw'.
# 'noncurses' is for systems that does not suport ncurses.

# 'raw' defaults to 200 bars, which can be adjusted in the 'bars' option above.

# Visual styles. Can be 'stereo' or 'mono'.
# 'stereo' mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# 'mono' averages both channels and outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies.

[color]

# default is to keep current terminal color
