# [RealStr1ke](https://github.com/RealStr1ke)'s dotfiles

Hi. I guess I left all of my dotfiles here sooooo...

**This is a work in progress and more information will come soon.**

## Installation

- Remote Installation

```Bash
bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RealStr1ke/dotfiles/master/install.sh`"
```

- Local Installation

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/RealStr1ke/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

This clones into the current directory, so remember to remove the cloned repository folder after the installation is complete, the real one will be located at `~/.dotfiles`.

```Bash
cd ..
rm dotfiles
```
