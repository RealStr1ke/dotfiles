# [RealStr1ke](https://github.com/RealStr1ke)'s dotfiles

## Welcome `~`

**Hi! Welcome to my mildly amusing dotfiles. I guess I kinda ~~wasted~~ spent a lot of time on these, but here they are. Have fun and rob what you want lol.**

## Installation

I provide the `install.sh` script to install these dotfiles, but I **HIGHLY** recommend you take a detailed look all of my configurations and the installation script so you'll know what's being affected.

```Bash
bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RealStr1ke/dotfiles/master/install.sh`"
```

## Information
**COMING SOON**
